    "description": "2024年我毕业了。仿佛早有预兆，我陷入了巨大的迷茫，失去了意义感。\n\n我执着地想弄清楚：我是谁？\n\n过去这么努力，究竟是为了什么？如果只是为了一份工作、一条看得清尽头的道路，这并不能说服我。\n\n坦白讲，经历了过去一年的许多失败，我不得不正视一个事实——我是一个普通人。我没有那么大的能力成为一个 great person，也没有能力跻身前10%或前5%。因此我开始退却，对于那些听起来有些幼稚的想法，对于我想要实现的改变。\n\n这个视频制作于那个时期。我想告诉自己：我只是我自己而已。好好玩这个游戏就好。即便我的人生失败了，这依旧是一件悲壮而骄傲的事——因为我完全在按照自己的意愿去做，在一点点靠近我的理想图景。这就够了。\n\n毕业后的这一年，这个视频成了我的锚点。每当犹豫的时候，我就会看一看，想想制作时那个我的希冀。\n\n很庆幸，现在我已经不再需要这个锚点了。但我依旧很感激。\n\n这是我成长的印记。\n\n—\n\nIn 2024, I graduated. As if it were fated, I fell into a deep sense of confusion and lost all sense of meaning.\n\nI was obsessed with one question: Who am I?\n\nWhat was all that effort for? If it was just for a job, a predictable path with a visible end — that wasn't enough to convince me.\n\nTo be honest, after many failures over the past year, I had to face a hard truth: I'm an ordinary person. I don't have what it takes to become a great person, nor the ability to be in the top 10% or 5%. So I began to retreat — from ideas that sounded naive, from the changes I wanted to make.\n\nThis video was made during that time. I wanted to tell myself: I'm just me. Just play the game well. Even if my life fails, it would still be something tragic yet proud — because I'm living entirely by my own will, inching closer to my vision. That's enough.\n\nIn the year after graduation, this video became my anchor. Whenever I hesitated, I would watch it and remember what that version of me hoped for.\n\nI'm grateful that I no longer need this anchor. But I'm still thankful for it.\n\nThis is a mark of my growth."
