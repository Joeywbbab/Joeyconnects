Looking back, I realize I truly shattered the me I had been for over twenty years, and rebuilt a new self.\n\nIn April, I joined a community and met a group of people there. We came together with a shared sentiment: None of us want to wither in the mundane world. I was surprised by how much we resonated with each other. Here was a group of people willing to accompany you in everything you wanted to do. I told them about the real me — and my lifelong idealism.\n\nHere, I regained my long-lost ability to love and be loved. When I shared this with Yiran, she asked me: What do you think your love for others is?\n\nI think it is no longer being stingy with my time for others — making breakfast for many, accompanying you to many places, doing many things together.\n\nI think it is being willing to take the initiative to create bonds."
