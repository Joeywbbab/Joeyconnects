For the past half-year, my feed has been haunted by posts on Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News with titles like:

"I vibe-coded a product in a weekend!"
"I shipped an app to the App Store in just 3 days!"

And honestly, I used to believe all of them.

I even tried it myself. I gave myself three hours to hack together a product demo — and technically, I succeeded. But then I rebuilt it. And rebuilt it again. And again. Four versions later, I realized the real problem wasn't coding speed — it was finding the right product structure and logic. You have to push yourself to the edge to find that fitting point.

## Why I Didn't Ship in a Week

I'll be honest — I really wanted to ship my app in a week. And it was possible. But shipping that fast would have felt irresponsible.

I don't want my app to become just another piece of digital trash floating around the App Store. My ambition is bigger than that. I want this product to actually influence people, to shape the way they work and think.

Vibe coding, for me, isn't about chasing virality or bragging rights. It's just a way to land my imagination, to turn ideas into something I can touch and test. But the real work — the product sense, the structure, the user empathy — can't be vibe-coded.

## Why Build a Note App at All?

Yes, I know. Another note-taking app? It sounds painfully cliché. Every solo developer seems to build one of three things at the beginning:

1. A to-do list
2. A budgeting app
3. A note-taking app

But here's my hot take: **if you can build a really good note-taking app, you can probably build any other kind of app.**

Why? Because note apps aren't just about CRUD operations. They're about understanding human psychology and behavior. A great note app reflects how people think, organize, and express themselves. To build one that resonates, the builder's own worldview has to be embedded in the design. If you can make that worldview click for users, they'll adopt your product — and in a way, your app becomes a statement about a way of living.

## How AI Changed the Game

Compared with the pre-AI era, AI has fundamentally changed how we build and ship products:

### Marketing > Ideas

Execution speed matters more than ideas now. As someone on Reddit put it,

> "In the AI era, ideas no longer speak louder than actions."

Your idea can and will be copied — what sets you apart is how fast you can execute and how effectively you can market.

### Vibe Coding is a Double-Edged Sword

Yes, AI makes building faster and lowers the barrier to entry — but it also creates a flood of products chasing fake or shallow demand. AI democratizes building, which is great, but traffic and hype only carry a product so far. Long-term success still comes down to whether the product actually solves a meaningful problem.

## What I Learned from a Senior PM

After talking with a senior PM about my note app, I finally saw what my first versions were missing: **true product sense.**

AI can generate code and wireframes, but it can't teach you to:

- Validate real user demand
- Define the right product structure
- Carefully map how features interact and depend on one another

The PM encouraged me to use **ER modeling** (Entity-Relationship diagrams) to map out my product features and their relationships before coding. That single shift in thinking made my product much more coherent.

## My Takeaway

AI is an amazing tool for solo developers — but you still have to do the deep thinking yourself.

Product sense isn't something you can copy-paste from ChatGPT. You have to cultivate it, and that takes time, reflection, and iteration. Shipping fast is exciting, but **if you want your product to matter, it deserves more than just a weekend.**

This October, I'll be shipping the fourth version of my note-taking app to the iOS App Store — the one that finally feels right. If you've been through your own cycle of building, scrapping, and rebuilding, I'd love to hear your story.

If you enjoyed this reflection, consider subscribing — I'll be sharing more behind-the-scenes notes on vibe-coding products, solo dev struggles, and little observations about how we live and work.
