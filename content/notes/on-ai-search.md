Been thinking about how AI search engines are fundamentally different from traditional search.

Google optimizes for clicks. ChatGPT/Claude optimize for answers.

This changes everything:

- No more "10 blue links"
- No more click-through rates
- No more keyword stuffing

Instead, we optimize for being the authoritative source that AI cites.

The shift from SEO to GEO isn't just technical - it's philosophical.
