I've noticed something about successful builders: they don't see obstacles, they see puzzles.

When most people hit a wall, they stop.

When problem-solvers hit a wall, they ask:
- Is there a way around it?
- Can I go over it?
- Can I break through it?
- Do I even need to cross this wall?

Often, the wall isn't the problem. The path is the problem.

Finding a different path is usually easier than breaking through the wall.
