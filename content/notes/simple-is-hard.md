Building simple products is incredibly hard.

It's easy to add features. It's hard to say no.

Every feature you add:
- Increases complexity
- Creates more edge cases
- Slows down the core experience
- Makes onboarding harder

The best products do one thing exceptionally well.

Linear is a project manager.
Notion is a workspace.
Figma is a design tool.

They could do more, but they don't. That's why they're great.
