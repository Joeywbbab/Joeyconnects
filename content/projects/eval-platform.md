title: Eval Platform
description: Evaluate and benchmark AI model outputs with systematic testing frameworks
problem: As AI applications become more complex, teams struggle to systematically evaluate model outputs. Manual testing is inconsistent and doesn't scale.
solution: A structured evaluation platform that enables systematic testing, comparison, and benchmarking of AI model responses.
features:
  - Structured evaluation frameworks
  - Side-by-side model comparison
  - Custom scoring rubrics
  - Test case management
tech:
  - Next.js
  - TypeScript
  - OpenAI API
  - Anthropic API

## How It Works

1. **Create test cases** — Define inputs and expected behaviors
2. **Run evaluations** — Test against multiple models or versions
3. **Score results** — Apply custom rubrics or automated scoring
4. **Compare and iterate** — Analyze differences and improve prompts

## Current Status

Active development. Core evaluation and comparison features are functional.
