description: A personal project management tool built for how I actually work
problem: Existing project management tools are either too complex (Jira, Asana) or too simple (todo lists). I needed something in between that fits my workflow.
solution: Building my own Linear-inspired project manager, optimized for solo developers with specific personal needs.
features:
  - Keyboard-first navigation
  - Minimal, distraction-free interface
  - Fast search and filtering
  - Markdown support
tech:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS

## Why Build This?

Tools like Linear are beautiful but designed for teams. Todo apps are too simple. I wanted something that:

- Feels as polished as Linear
- Works for solo projects
- Fits my specific workflow
- Is fast and keyboard-driven

## Current Status

This is an active experiment. The prototype is functional but not the final version — still iterating on the core workflow and UI details.

Building this as I use it, adding features when I actually need them rather than guessing what might be useful.
