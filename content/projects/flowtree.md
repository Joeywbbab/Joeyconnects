description: Interactive flow management tool for product designers
problem: Vibe coding produces messy code. When development timelines are tight, engineers reading code directly encounter misleading information. Documentation alone is never intuitive enough — there's always room for misunderstanding. Clear page flows and navigation paths are essential for team collaboration.
solution: A visual tool that lets designers create, test, and iterate on user flows in real-time, making page structures and transitions explicit for the entire team.
features:
  - Drag-and-drop flow builder
  - Interactive prototype mode
  - Export to various formats
  - Collaborative editing
tech:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript
  - LocalStorage API

## How It Works

The tool uses a simple node-based system where each node represents a step in your user journey. Connect nodes to create paths, add conditions for branching, and test the entire flow interactively.

All data is stored locally in your browser, so your flows are private and always available.
