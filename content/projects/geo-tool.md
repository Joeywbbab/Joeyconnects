features:
  - Query your brand across multiple AI engines
  - Track visibility scores over time
  - Get optimization recommendations
  - Compare with competitors
tech:
  - Next.js
  - TypeScript
  - OpenAI API
  - Anthropic API
  - Supabase

## Prototypes

**Version 1** — [aeo-1-0.vercel.app](https://aeo-1-0.vercel.app/dashboard)
Basic GEO functionality with a clean SaaS-style interface. Focuses on core monitoring features that align with typical overseas product patterns.

**Version 2** — [amplift.vercel.app](https://amplift.vercel.app/visibility/overview)
Enhanced with deeper analysis capabilities and agent-assisted insights. Moves beyond simple monitoring into actionable intelligence.

### What Changed Between Versions

| Aspect | V1 | V2 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Focus | Core monitoring | Analysis + insights |
| Interface | Classic SaaS dashboard | Analysis-first design |
| Intelligence | Rule-based recommendations | Agent-assisted analysis |
| Target | Basic visibility tracking | Strategic optimization |

## How It Works

1. **Set up queries** — Define what questions people might ask about your brand
2. **Run checks** — Automatically query AI engines on a schedule
3. **Analyze results** — Get detailed reports on visibility and sentiment
4. **Optimize** — Implement recommendations and track improvements

## Current Status

This project is currently in active development. V2 is live with agent-assisted analysis capabilities.
